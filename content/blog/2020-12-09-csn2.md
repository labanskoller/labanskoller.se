This is a follow-up on the previous post [Brute-Forcing Borrowers' PINs at the
Swedish Board of Student Finance (CSN)]({{<ref 2020-11-23-csn.md>}}) where I
describe some vulnerabilities discovered in August 2020 and the response from
CSN. It seems I missed another problem with the CAPTCHA though. And it was
right in front of my eyes...

If you read my previous post you might have spotted it
yourself. If not, you get one more chance now before I tell you. Please study
this screenshot carefully (or [skip to the vulnerability]({{<ref
"#the-vulnerability" >}}) if you prefer):

Can you spot something that might be a problem? No, it's not that the correct
numbers are pre-filled in the input field. I entered them before taking the
screenshot. :)

# The Vulnerability

The important part in the above screenshot is:
> <a href="https://tjanster.csn.se/bas/captcha?visaSiffror=true"
   target="_blank">Can't see the picture?</a> When you
> click on the link, the numbers will appear in a new window. It takes about 30
> seconds until you see the numbers.

I _did_ read that section several times back in August but didn't think much of
what it meant and I never clicked the link. But when I did...

{{< figure src="../../../../images/not_always_click_links.jpg"
           alt="Meme: I DON'T ALWAYS CLICK THE LINKS - BUT WHEN I DO, I FIND VULNERABILITIES" >}}

The link <a href="https://tjanster.csn.se/bas/captcha?visaSiffror=true"
target="_blank">Can't see the picture?</a> goes to the page
`captcha?visaSiffror=true`. _visaSiffror_ is Swedish for _showNumbers_.  The
HTTP request made when clicking the link will return the correct number for the
CAPTCHA in text format but after 30 seconds. So the CAPTCHA is not a problem at
all for robots -- it's just a delay. This is probably thought of as a feature
rather than a bug to facilitate for people with disabilities but the security
consequences are rather huge.

A new number is randomized every time the page `captcha` is requested. The page
`captcha?visaSiffror=true` will return the number from the last CAPTCHA
generated. When this blog post was published the CAPTCHA solution was still
online even though the page for ordering new PIN codes was disabled due to my
previous findings. CSN don't know (!) if the CAPTCHA solution is used
elsewhere on their site. This means you can probably still play along in this
proof of concept. Links will open in a new tab/window.

<a name="private-window"></a>
1. Open [this blog post](#private-window) in a new private/incognito window to
   get rid of old cookies etcetera. Follow the rest of the instructions in that
window.
1. Visit <a href="https://tjanster.csn.se/bas/does-not-exist"
   target="_blank">`/bas/does-not-exist`</a> to get a `JSESSIONID` cookie
1. Visit <a href="https://tjanster.csn.se/bas/captcha?visaSiffror=true"
   target="_blank">`captcha?visaSiffror=true`</a>
1. Wait 30 seconds for the request to finish
1. Observe the text `null` which means no CAPTCHA number to show exists
1. Visit <a href="https://tjanster.csn.se/bas/captcha"
   target="_blank">`captcha`</a>
1. Observe an image with a five-digit number. Example:
   {{< figure src="../../../../images/csn2_captcha_25853.jpg" alt="25853" >}}
1. Reload the page
1. Observe an image with a new five-digit number. Example:
   {{< figure src="../../../../images/csn2_captcha_45345.jpg" alt="45345" >}}
1. Remember the number (or leave that tab/window open)
1. Once again visit <a
   href="https://tjanster.csn.se/bas/captcha?visaSiffror=true"
   target="_blank">`captcha?visaSiffror=true`</a>
1. Wait 30 seconds for the request to finish
1. Observe the number now written as text. Example: `45345`

In the [previous post]({{<ref 2020-11-23-csn.md>}}) I concluded that a brute
force attack on an account's PIN succeeds in average after 6930 guesses. Using
the above method in a sequential script means an attack would take less than
twelve hours on average.

The CAPTCHA number is not tied to the person requesting a new PIN code however,
but to the browser session represented by the `JSESSIONID` cookie, so multiple
CAPTCHAs can be valid for an account at any given time. My idea is that the
waiting for 30 seconds can be parallelized so that several threads fetch
separate CAPTCHAs, wait 30 seconds, and then order new PINs.

{{< figure src="../../../../images/csn2_parallel_captcha.png"
           caption="Diagram of parallelized CAPTCHA solving" >}}

The idea is to prepare multiple sessions with known CAPTCHA numbers and then
use them when needed when ordering new PINs. Every time a new PIN is ordered,
five new PIN code guesses are allowed.

So this is a method of allowing an automated brute force attack against a
victim's (frequently changing) PIN even if the CAPTCHA bypass vulnerability
described in the previous post is solved.

# Reporting The Vulnerability

Since the only functionality that I know of where the broken CAPTCHA was being
used was turned off, I decided to report the vulnerability to CSN with just a
seven-day disclosure deadline to give them some time to inform me if the
CAPTCHA is being used elsewhere. If it was, I would give them 90 days instead.
They responded that they don't know (!) whether the CAPTCHA is being used
elsewhere and have no estimate on when they will, so I decided to publish this
post as soon as it was finished.

My recommendation to CSN is to solve the described vulnerability before opening
up the functionality for ordering new PINs again.

In the report sent to CSN (and CERT-SE) I also included four other possible
attack scenarios. Those four are probably possible to perform right now and I
don't know of any mitigations, so I will apply a 90-day disclosure deadline to
those and publish them on the 24th of February 2021 at the earliest.

# security.txt Partly Implemented

But CSN did do _something_ right. Almost at least...

In August I recommended CSN to publish a vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP)
and a [security.txt file](https://securitytxt.org/) with a communication
channel for vulnerability reports. Friday the 4th of December 2020 I saw that
they have actually [published
one](https://www.csn.se/.well-known/security.txt). It doesn't follow [the
specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-10#section-5)
since the content type is `text/html` instead of `text/plain` and the page is
full of HTML tags so it cannot be parsed by a machine but it gets the message
through to a human eye so it's definitely better than not having one. The
`Contact` field is missing the `mailto` URI scheme but that's true for
[Defensify](https://defensify.se/home)'s [security.txt
file](https://defensify.se/.well-known/security.txt) as well (where I work).
That file is by the way presented as a download instead of as a page due to
Squarespace's missing support for plain text files. The
[tjanster.csn.se](http://tjanster.csn.se/.well-known/security.txt) domain where
the vulnerabilities I've found reside doesn't have a security.txt file however.
