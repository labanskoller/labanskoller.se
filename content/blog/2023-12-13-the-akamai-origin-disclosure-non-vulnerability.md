When working for my employer Sentor I discovered an origin disclosure vulnerability in Akamai GTM, but they didn't agree it was a vulnerability. I blogged about it on the company blog: [The Akamai origin disclosure non-vulnerability](https://sentorsecurity.com/blog/the-akamai-origin-disclosure-non-vulnerability/)
